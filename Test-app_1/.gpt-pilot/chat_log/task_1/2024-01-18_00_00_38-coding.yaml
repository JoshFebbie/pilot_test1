  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: 'You are working on a App called "Test-app_1" and you need to write code for the entire app based on the tasks
    that the tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you''re working on, you''re given other specs for "Test-app_1"
    as well.


    Here is a high level description of "Test-app_1":

    ```

    A tic-tac-toe application, Test-app_1, will be created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The back end will feature an authentication
    process where users can sign up or log in using their email or username/ID. MongoDB will be utilized as the database to
    store user information, and upon successful login, players'' names will be displayed on-screen.


    The application will support both single-player games against the computer and multiplayer games between users. A leaderboard
    will be integrated to track player statistics. For security and user management, the authentication system will include
    password recovery and email verification features.


    Gameplay victories and ties will trigger pre-recorded audio responses, such as announcing the winner or declaring a tie.
    The application will incorporate CORS to ensure cross-origin efficiency and responsiveness on various devices and screen
    sizes.

    ```



    Here are the technologies that you need to use for this project:

    ```


    - Node.js


    - Express


    - MongoDB


    - Mongoose


    - Passport


    - Passport-local


    - bcrypt


    - jsonwebtoken


    - nodemailer


    - React


    - Redux


    - axios


    - HTML5


    - CSS3


    - Bootstrap


    - Socket.io


    - cors


    - howler.js


    ```






    We''ve broken the development of this app down to these tasks:

    ```

    1. Initialize a Node.js project with Express and set up a basic server with a `/ping` route that responds with `{status:
    ''ok''}` when queried.


    2. Create MongoDB connection using Mongoose and design a User schema to handle user information including username, email,
    and password.


    3. Implement user authentication APIs for sign-up and login using Passport and Passport-local, which encrypts passwords
    using bcrypt.


    4. Develop email verification and password recovery features using nodemailer, jsonwebtoken, and additional MongoDB schema
    fields as necessary.


    5. Set up React application with Redux for state management and implement the base layout using HTML5 and Bootstrap, adding
    responsive design considerations.


    6. Build front-end components for single-player tic-tac-toe game mechanics and integrate game state management with Redux.


    7. Implement the multiplayer gameplay functionality using Socket.io for real-time communication between clients and the
    server.


    8. Create a leaderboard system that records user statistics such as wins, losses, and ties, and use MongoDB to persist
    this data.


    9. Integrate pre-recorded audio responses using howler.js for in-game events such as victories and ties.


    10. Ensure the backend is set up to handle CORS using the `cors` npm package to allow for secure cross-origin requests.


    ```


    You are currently working on task #1 with the following description:

    ```

    Initialize a Node.js project with Express and set up a basic server with a `/ping` route that responds with `{status:
    ''ok''}` when queried.

    ```


    After all the code is finished, a human developer will check if the app works this way - `Verify that when accessing `/ping`
    route in a browser or through a tool like Postman, the response received is a JSON object with `{status: ''ok''}`.`


    Now, tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands
    that need to be run to implement this task.


    **IMPORTANT**

    When you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code
    in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split
    it into smaller files.


    **IMPORTANT**

    Remember, I created an empty folder where I will start writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.

    You do not need to make any automated tests work.


    DO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will be created automatically - just specify the relative
    path to each file that needs to be written.


    Never use the port 5000 to run the app, it''s reserved.'

  content: "First, you need to initialize your Node.js application with npm and install the necessary packages.\n\nRun the\
    \ following commands in your project root directory:\n\n```sh\nnpm init -y\nnpm install express cors\n```\n\nNext, create\
    \ the main entry point for your Node.js application:\n\n- **`/index.js`**:\n    ```javascript\n    const express = require('express');\n\
    \    const cors = require('cors');\n\n    const app = express();\n\n    // Middlewares\n    app.use(cors());\n    app.use(express.json());\n\

    \ application like so:\n\n```sh\nnode index.js\n```\n\nAfter running your application, when the `/ping` route is queried,\
    \ either via a web browser or a tool like Postman at `http://localhost:3000/ping` (assuming you are running on the default\
    \ port 3000), it should respond with a JSON object:\n\n```json\n{\"status\": \"ok\"}\n```\n\nThis will complete task #1\

  content: 'How can a human user test if this task was completed successfully? If you specify a command that needs to be run
    or give example, be very specific. You don''t want the user to have to think anything through but rather that they just
    follow your instructions. Note that any commands will be run on a Windows machine.


    **IMPORTANT**

    In case the task can be tested by making an API request, do not suggest how can a request be made with Postman but rather
    write a full cURL command that the user can just run.

    **IMPORTANT**

    Do not require any code writing form the user for testing this task.


    Try your best to avoid this if possible, but if it is very difficult to test the task, you can just answer with only this
    sentence - `There is nothing specific to test for this task so you can write "continue" and we''ll move on to the next
    task.`'
response: 'To test if the task was completed successfully, follow these instructions:


  1. Make sure you have started the Node.js application by running the command in a Command Prompt window in the project root
  directory:


  ```sh

  node index.js

  ```


  2. Open another Command Prompt window and execute the following cURL command:


  ```sh

  curl http://localhost:3000/ping

  ```


  You should receive a response in the format of:


  ```json

  {"status": "ok"}

  ```


  If you see this response, it means the `/ping` route is set up correctly and responding as expected.'
