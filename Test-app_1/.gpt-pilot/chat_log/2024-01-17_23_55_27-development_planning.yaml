  content: You are an experienced tech lead in a software development agency and your main task is to break down the project
    into smaller tasks that developers will do. You must specify each task as clear as possible. Each task must have a description
    of what needs to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done from a programmatic
    perspective and user-review goal that will determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will
    be reviewed by a human.

  content: 'You are working in a software development agency and a project manager and software architect approach you telling
    you that you''re assigned to work on a new project. You are working on a App called "Test-app_1" and you need to create
    a detailed development plan so that developers can start developing the app.


    Here is a high level description of "Test-app_1":

    ```

    A tic-tac-toe application, Test-app_1, will be created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The back end will feature an authentication
    process where users can sign up or log in using their email or username/ID. MongoDB will be utilized as the database to
    store user information, and upon successful login, players'' names will be displayed on-screen.


    The application will support both single-player games against the computer and multiplayer games between users. A leaderboard
    will be integrated to track player statistics. For security and user management, the authentication system will include
    password recovery and email verification features.


    Gameplay victories and ties will trigger pre-recorded audio responses, such as announcing the winner or declaring a tie.
    The application will incorporate CORS to ensure cross-origin efficiency and responsiveness on various devices and screen
    sizes.

    ```



    Here are the technologies that you need to use for this project:

    ```


    - Node.js


    - Express


    - MongoDB


    - Mongoose


    - Passport


    - Passport-local


    - bcrypt


    - jsonwebtoken


    - nodemailer


    - React


    - Redux


    - axios


    - HTML5


    - CSS3


    - Bootstrap


    - Socket.io


    - cors


    - howler.js


    ```




    Before we go into the coding part, I want you to split the development process of creating this app into smaller tasks
    so that it is easier to develop, debug and make the app work. Each smaller task of this app has to be a whole that can
    be reviewed by a developer to make sure we''re on a right track to create this app completely.


    Each task needs to be related only to the development of this app and nothing else - once the app is fully working, that
    is it. There shouldn''t be a task for researching, deployment, writing documentation, or anything that is not writing
    the actual code.


    Now, based on the project details provided, think task by task and create the entire development plan. Start from the
    project setup and specify each task until the moment when the entire app should be fully working.


    **IMPORTANT**

    Dividing project into tasks is extremely important job and has to be done carefully while always strictly following all
    rules listed bellow.


    Rule #1

    There should never be a task that is only testing or ensuring something works, every task must have coding involved. Have
    this in mind for every task, but it is extremely important for last task of project. Testing if app works will be done
    as part of each task.


    Rule #2

    You have to make sure the project is not split into tasks that are too small or simple for no reason but also not too
    big or complex so that they are hard to develop, debug and review. Here are examples of poorly created tasks:


    **too simple tasks**

    - Set up a Node.js project and install all necessary dependencies.

    - Establish a MongoDB database connection using Mongoose with the IP ''127.0.0.1''.


    **too complex tasks**

    - Set up Node.js project with /home, /profile, /register and /login routes that will have user authentication, connection
    to MongoDB with user schemas, mailing of new users and frontend with nice design.


    You must to avoid creating tasks that are too simple or too complex. You have to aim to create tasks that are medium complexity.
    Here are examples of tasks that are good:


    **good tasks**

    - Set up a Node.js project, install all necessary dependencies and set up an express server with a simple route to `/ping`
    that returns the status 200.

    - Establish a MongoDB database connection and implement the message schema using Mongoose for persistent storage of messages.


    Rule #3

    Every app should have different number of tasks depending on complexity. Think task by task and create the minimum number
    of tasks that are relevant for this specific app. Here are some examples of apps with different complexity that can give
    you guidance on how many tasks you should create:


    Example #1:

    app description: "I want to create an app that will just say ''Hello World'' when I open it on my localhost:3000."

    number of tasks: 1-3


    Example #2:

    app description: "Create a node.js app that enables users to register and log into the app. On frontend it should have
    /home (shows user data), /register and /login. It should use sessions to keep user logged in."

    number of tasks: 2-6


    Example #3:

    app description: "A cool online shoe store, with a sleek look. In terms of data models, there are shoes, categories and
    user profiles. For web pages: product listing, details, shopping cart. It must look cool and jazzy."

    number of tasks: 5-15'
