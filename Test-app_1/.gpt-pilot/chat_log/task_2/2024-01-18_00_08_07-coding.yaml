  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"Test-app_1\" and you need to write code for the entire app based on the tasks\
    \ that the tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you're working on, you're given other specs for \"\
    Test-app_1\" as well.\n\nHere is a high level description of \"Test-app_1\":\n```\nA tic-tac-toe application, Test-app_1,\
    \ will be created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The back end will feature an authentication process where users can\
    \ sign up or log in using their email or username/ID. MongoDB will be utilized as the database to store user information,\
    \ and upon successful login, players' names will be displayed on-screen.\n\nThe application will support both single-player\
    \ games against the computer and multiplayer games between users. A leaderboard will be integrated to track player statistics.\
    \ For security and user management, the authentication system will include password recovery and email verification features.\n\
    \nGameplay victories and ties will trigger pre-recorded audio responses, such as announcing the winner or declaring a\
    \ tie. The application will incorporate CORS to ensure cross-origin efficiency and responsiveness on various devices and\
    \ screen sizes.\n```\n\n\nHere are the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n\n- Node.js\n\n- Express\n\
    \n- MongoDB\n\n- Mongoose\n\n- Passport\n\n- Passport-local\n\n- bcrypt\n\n- jsonwebtoken\n\n- nodemailer\n\n- React\n\
    \n- Redux\n\n- axios\n\n- HTML5\n\n- CSS3\n\n- Bootstrap\n\n- Socket.io\n\n- cors\n\n- howler.js\n\n```\n\n\n\n\nSo far,\
    \ this code has been implemented:\n\n**/package.json**\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"test-app_1\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\
    ,\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"directories\": {\n    \"test\": \"tests\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\"\
    : {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [],\n  \"author\": \"\"\
    ,\n  \"license\": \"ISC\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"cors\": \"^2.8.5\",\n    \"express\": \"^4.18.2\"\n  }\n}\n\n\
    ```\n\n\n**/index.js**\n```\nconst express = require('express');\nconst cors = require('cors');\n\nconst app = express();\n\
    \n// Middlewares\napp.use(cors());\napp.use(express.json());\n\n// Ping route\napp.get('/ping', (req, res) => {\n    res.json({\
    \ status: 'ok' });\n});\n\n// Starting the server\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001;\napp.listen(PORT, () => {\n\
    \    console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);  // INPUT_REQUIRED: Replace with a console log of your choosing, if\
    \ desired\n});\n```\n\n\n\n\nWe've broken the development of this app down to these tasks:\n```\n1. Initialize a Node.js\
    \ project with Express and set up a basic server with a `/ping` route that responds with `{status: 'ok'}` when queried.\n\
    \n2. Create MongoDB connection using Mongoose and design a User schema to handle user information including username,\
    \ email, and password.\n\n3. Implement user authentication APIs for sign-up and login using Passport and Passport-local,\
    \ which encrypts passwords using bcrypt.\n\n4. Develop email verification and password recovery features using nodemailer,\
    \ jsonwebtoken, and additional MongoDB schema fields as necessary.\n\n5. Set up React application with Redux for state\
    \ management and implement the base layout using HTML5 and Bootstrap, adding responsive design considerations.\n\n6. Build\
    \ front-end components for single-player tic-tac-toe game mechanics and integrate game state management with Redux.\n\n\
    7. Implement the multiplayer gameplay functionality using Socket.io for real-time communication between clients and the\
    \ server.\n\n8. Create a leaderboard system that records user statistics such as wins, losses, and ties, and use MongoDB\
    \ to persist this data.\n\n9. Integrate pre-recorded audio responses using howler.js for in-game events such as victories\
    \ and ties.\n\n10. Ensure the backend is set up to handle CORS using the `cors` npm package to allow for secure cross-origin\
    \ requests.\n\n```\n\nYou are currently working on task #2 with the following description:\n```\nCreate MongoDB connection\
    \ using Mongoose and design a User schema to handle user information including username, email, and password.\n```\nAll\
    \ previous tasks are finished and you don't have to work on them.\nAfter all the code is finished, a human developer will\
    \ check if the app works this way - `Review of the database directly should show the User schema with appropriate fields.`\n\
    \nNow, tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands\
    \ that need to be run to implement this task.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nWhen you think about in which file should the new code\
    \ go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file.\
    \ Whenever a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split it into smaller files.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nRemember,\
    \ I created an empty folder where I will start writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.\nYou do\
    \ not need to make any automated tests work.\n\nDO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will be created\
    \ automatically - just specify the relative path to each file that needs to be written.\n\nNever use the port 5000 to\
    \ run the app, it's reserved."

  content: "Below are the steps and code snippets you will need to accomplish the described task.\n\n### Step 1: Install Required\
    \ NPM Packages\nRun the following command to install Mongoose and other necessary packages for this task:\n```sh\nnpm\
    \ install mongoose bcrypt\n```\n\n### Step 2: Set Up the MongoDB Connection\nCreate a file to establish the connection\
    \ to MongoDB and handle the configuration.\n\n**/config/db.js**\n```javascript\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\n\
    \nconst connectDB = async () => {\n  try {\n    await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, {\n      useNewUrlParser:\
    \ true,\n      useUnifiedTopology: true,\n    });\n\n    console.log('MongoDB Connected...');\n  } catch (err) {\n   \
    \ console.error(err.message);\n    process.exit(1);\n  }\n};\n\nmodule.exports = connectDB;\n```\n\n### Step 3: Configure\
    \ environment variables\nBefore moving on, you will need a `.env` file at the root of your project to store environment\
    \ variables like your MongoDB URI.\n\n**/.env**\n```\nMONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string\n```\n\nReplace \"your_mongodb_connection_string\"\
    \ with your actual MongoDB connection string.\n\n### Step 4: Import the MongoDB Connection to `index.js`\nModify the `/index.js`\
    \ file to connect the database when the server starts.\n\n**/index.js**\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\n\
    const cors = require('cors');\nconst connectDB = require('./config/db'); // Import connectDB function\n\nconst app = express();\n\
    \n// Connect to the database\nconnectDB();\n\n// Middlewares\napp.use(cors());\napp.use(express.json());\n\n// Ping route\n\
    app.get('/ping', (req, res) => {\n    res.json({ status: 'ok' });\n});\n\n// Starting the server\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT\
    \ || 3001;\napp.listen(PORT, () => {\n    console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);\n});\n\n// Add this if not already\
    \ present\nrequire('dotenv').config();\n```\n\n### Step 5: Create the User Schema and Model\nNow create the User schema\
    \ in a separate file.\n\n**/models/User.js**\n```javascript\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\nconst bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');\n\
    \nconst UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({\n  username: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true,\n    unique: true,\n\
    \  },\n  email: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true,\n    unique: true,\n  },\n  password: {\n    type: String,\n\
    \    required: true,\n  }\n});\n\n// Pre-save hook to hash password before saving a new user\nUserSchema.pre('save', async\
    \ function (next) {\n  // Only hash the password if it has been modified (or is new)\n  if (!this.isModified('password'))\
    \ return next();\n\n  // Generate a salt and hash on separate function calls\n  const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);\n\
    \  this.password = await bcrypt.hash(this.password, salt);\n  next();\n});\n\nconst User = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);\n\
    \nmodule.exports = User;\n```\n\nYou have now established the MongoDB connection and defined your `User` schema and model.\
    \ Remember that in order to test this effectively, you will need to set up the routes and controllers to actually create\
    \ users in the MongoDB database, but that is part of a different task.\n\nThis should fulfill the current task of creating\
    \ a MongoDB connection using Mongoose and designing a User schema to handle user info including username, email, and password.\
    \ The database review should show the User schema with the appropriate fields if you were to test this with a route handler\
    \ that creates users, which will be in a subsequent task."

  content: 'Ok, now, take your previous message and convert it to actionable items. An item might be a code change or a command
    run. When you need to change code, make sure that you put the entire content of the file in the value of `content` key
    even though you will likely copy and paste the most of the previous message. The commands must be able to run on a Windows
    machine.


    **IMPORTANT**

    Within the file modifications, anything needs to be written by the user, add the comment in the same line as the code
    that starts with `// INPUT_REQUIRED {input_description}` where `input_description` is a description of what needs to be
    added here by the user. Just make sure that you put comments only inside files that support comments (e.g. not in JSON
    files).


    **IMPORTANT**

    When you want to add a comment that tells the user to add the previous implementation at that place, make sure that the
    comment starts with `[OLD CODE]` and add a description of what old code should be inserted here. For example, `[OLD CODE]
    Login route`.


    **IMPORTANT**

    When you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code
    in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split
    it into smaller files.'
