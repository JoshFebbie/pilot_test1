  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

  content: "You are working on a App called \"Test-app_1\" and you need to write code for the entire app based on the tasks\
    \ that the tech lead gives you. So that you understand better what you're working on, you're given other specs for \"\
    Test-app_1\" as well.\n\nHere is a high level description of \"Test-app_1\":\n```\nA tic-tac-toe application, Test-app_1,\
    \ will be created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The back end will feature an authentication process where users can\
    \ sign up or log in using their email or username/ID. MongoDB will be utilized as the database to store user information,\
    \ and upon successful login, players' names will be displayed on-screen.\n\nThe application will support both single-player\
    \ games against the computer and multiplayer games between users. A leaderboard will be integrated to track player statistics.\
    \ For security and user management, the authentication system will include password recovery and email verification features.\n\
    \nGameplay victories and ties will trigger pre-recorded audio responses, such as announcing the winner or declaring a\
    \ tie. The application will incorporate CORS to ensure cross-origin efficiency and responsiveness on various devices and\
    \ screen sizes.\n```\n\n\nHere are the technologies that you need to use for this project:\n```\n\n- Node.js\n\n- Express\n\
    \n- MongoDB\n\n- Mongoose\n\n- Passport\n\n- Passport-local\n\n- bcrypt\n\n- jsonwebtoken\n\n- nodemailer\n\n- React\n\
    \n- Redux\n\n- axios\n\n- HTML5\n\n- CSS3\n\n- Bootstrap\n\n- Socket.io\n\n- cors\n\n- howler.js\n\n```\n\n\n\n\nSo far,\
    \ this code has been implemented:\n\n**/package.json**\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"test-app_1\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\
    ,\n  \"description\": \"\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"directories\": {\n    \"test\": \"tests\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\"\
    : {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [],\n  \"author\": \"\"\
    ,\n  \"license\": \"ISC\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"cors\": \"^2.8.5\",\n    \"express\": \"^4.18.2\"\n  }\n}\n\n\
    ```\n\n\n**/index.js**\n```\nconst express = require('express');\nconst cors = require('cors');\n\nconst app = express();\n\
    \n// Middlewares\napp.use(cors());\napp.use(express.json());\n\n// Ping route\napp.get('/ping', (req, res) => {\n    res.json({\
    \ status: 'ok' });\n});\n\n// Starting the server\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001;\napp.listen(PORT, () => {\n\
    \    console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);  // INPUT_REQUIRED: Replace with a console log of your choosing, if\
    \ desired\n});\n```\n\n\n\n\nWe've broken the development of this app down to these tasks:\n```\n1. Initialize a Node.js\
    \ project with Express and set up a basic server with a `/ping` route that responds with `{status: 'ok'}` when queried.\n\
    \n2. Create MongoDB connection using Mongoose and design a User schema to handle user information including username,\
    \ email, and password.\n\n3. Implement user authentication APIs for sign-up and login using Passport and Passport-local,\
    \ which encrypts passwords using bcrypt.\n\n4. Develop email verification and password recovery features using nodemailer,\
    \ jsonwebtoken, and additional MongoDB schema fields as necessary.\n\n5. Set up React application with Redux for state\
    \ management and implement the base layout using HTML5 and Bootstrap, adding responsive design considerations.\n\n6. Build\
    \ front-end components for single-player tic-tac-toe game mechanics and integrate game state management with Redux.\n\n\
    7. Implement the multiplayer gameplay functionality using Socket.io for real-time communication between clients and the\
    \ server.\n\n8. Create a leaderboard system that records user statistics such as wins, losses, and ties, and use MongoDB\
    \ to persist this data.\n\n9. Integrate pre-recorded audio responses using howler.js for in-game events such as victories\
    \ and ties.\n\n10. Ensure the backend is set up to handle CORS using the `cors` npm package to allow for secure cross-origin\
    \ requests.\n\n```\n\nYou are currently working on task #2 with the following description:\n```\nCreate MongoDB connection\
    \ using Mongoose and design a User schema to handle user information including username, email, and password.\n```\nAll\
    \ previous tasks are finished and you don't have to work on them.\nAfter all the code is finished, a human developer will\
    \ check if the app works this way - `Review of the database directly should show the User schema with appropriate fields.`\n\
    \nNow, tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands\
    \ that need to be run to implement this task.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nWhen you think about in which file should the new code\
    \ go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file.\
    \ Whenever a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split it into smaller files.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nRemember,\
    \ I created an empty folder where I will start writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.\nYou do\
    \ not need to make any automated tests work.\n\nDO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will be created\
    \ automatically - just specify the relative path to each file that needs to be written.\n\nNever use the port 5000 to\
    \ run the app, it's reserved."
response: "Below are the steps and code snippets you will need to accomplish the described task.\n\n### Step 1: Install Required\
  \ NPM Packages\nRun the following command to install Mongoose and other necessary packages for this task:\n```sh\nnpm install\
  \ mongoose bcrypt\n```\n\n### Step 2: Set Up the MongoDB Connection\nCreate a file to establish the connection to MongoDB\
  \ and handle the configuration.\n\n**/config/db.js**\n```javascript\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\n\nconst connectDB\
  \ = async () => {\n  try {\n    await mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI, {\n      useNewUrlParser: true,\n      useUnifiedTopology:\
  \ true,\n    });\n\n    console.log('MongoDB Connected...');\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error(err.message);\n    process.exit(1);\n\
  \  }\n};\n\nmodule.exports = connectDB;\n```\n\n### Step 3: Configure environment variables\nBefore moving on, you will\
  \ need a `.env` file at the root of your project to store environment variables like your MongoDB URI.\n\n**/.env**\n```\n\
  MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string\n```\n\nReplace \"your_mongodb_connection_string\" with your actual MongoDB connection\
  \ string.\n\n### Step 4: Import the MongoDB Connection to `index.js`\nModify the `/index.js` file to connect the database\
  \ when the server starts.\n\n**/index.js**\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst cors = require('cors');\n\
  const connectDB = require('./config/db'); // Import connectDB function\n\nconst app = express();\n\n// Connect to the database\n\
  connectDB();\n\n// Middlewares\napp.use(cors());\napp.use(express.json());\n\n// Ping route\napp.get('/ping', (req, res)\
  \ => {\n    res.json({ status: 'ok' });\n});\n\n// Starting the server\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001;\napp.listen(PORT,\
  \ () => {\n    console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);\n});\n\n// Add this if not already present\nrequire('dotenv').config();\n\
  ```\n\n### Step 5: Create the User Schema and Model\nNow create the User schema in a separate file.\n\n**/models/User.js**\n\
  ```javascript\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\nconst bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');\n\nconst UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({\n\
  \  username: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true,\n    unique: true,\n  },\n  email: {\n    type: String,\n    required:\
  \ true,\n    unique: true,\n  },\n  password: {\n    type: String,\n    required: true,\n  }\n});\n\n// Pre-save hook to\
  \ hash password before saving a new user\nUserSchema.pre('save', async function (next) {\n  // Only hash the password if\
  \ it has been modified (or is new)\n  if (!this.isModified('password')) return next();\n\n  // Generate a salt and hash\
  \ on separate function calls\n  const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);\n  this.password = await bcrypt.hash(this.password,\
  \ salt);\n  next();\n});\n\nconst User = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);\n\nmodule.exports = User;\n```\n\nYou have\
  \ now established the MongoDB connection and defined your `User` schema and model. Remember that in order to test this effectively,\
  \ you will need to set up the routes and controllers to actually create users in the MongoDB database, but that is part\
  \ of a different task.\n\nThis should fulfill the current task of creating a MongoDB connection using Mongoose and designing\
  \ a User schema to handle user info including username, email, and password. The database review should show the User schema\
  \ with the appropriate fields if you were to test this with a route handler that creates users, which will be in a subsequent\
  \ task."
