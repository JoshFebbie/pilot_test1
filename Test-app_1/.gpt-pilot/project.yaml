name: Test-app_1
description: 'A tic-tac-toe application, Test-app_1, will be created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The back end will feature
  an authentication process where users can sign up or log in using their email or username/ID. MongoDB will be utilized as
  the database to store user information, and upon successful login, players'' names will be displayed on-screen.


  The application will support both single-player games against the computer and multiplayer games between users. A leaderboard
  will be integrated to track player statistics. For security and user management, the authentication system will include
  password recovery and email verification features.


  Gameplay victories and ties will trigger pre-recorded audio responses, such as announcing the winner or declaring a tie.
  The application will incorporate CORS to ensure cross-origin efficiency and responsiveness on various devices and screen
  sizes.'

development_plan:
- description: 'Initialize a Node.js project with Express and set up a basic server with a `/ping` route that responds with
    `{status: ''ok''}` when queried.'
  programmatic_goal: 'A successful GET request to `/ping` must return a JSON object with `{status: ''ok''}` and HTTP status
    code 200.'
  user_review_goal: 'Verify that when accessing `/ping` route in a browser or through a tool like Postman, the response received
    is a JSON object with `{status: ''ok''}`.'
- description: Create MongoDB connection using Mongoose and design a User schema to handle user information including username,
    email, and password.
  programmatic_goal: Upon application startup, MongoDB successfully connects, and a User schema model allows creation and
    retrieval of user documents.
  user_review_goal: Review of the database directly should show the User schema with appropriate fields.
- description: Implement user authentication APIs for sign-up and login using Passport and Passport-local, which encrypts
    passwords using bcrypt.
  programmatic_goal: Users should be able to sign up and log in with a username and password via POST requests to `/auth/signup`
    and `/auth/login` respectively, with appropriate response messages and status codes.
  user_review_goal: Verify that new users can register and existing users can log in with correct credentials and receive
    proper response messages.
- description: Develop email verification and password recovery features using nodemailer, jsonwebtoken, and additional MongoDB
    schema fields as necessary.
  programmatic_goal: Signing up triggers an email with a verification link, and a POST request to `/auth/recover` sends an
    email with a password reset link. Both must be verifiable via provided tokens.
  user_review_goal: Ensure email verification works upon new user signup and that the password recovery process correctly
    allows resetting the password.
- description: Set up React application with Redux for state management and implement the base layout using HTML5 and Bootstrap,
    adding responsive design considerations.
  programmatic_goal: A running React app displays a responsive and visually coherent page at the root path `/` with Bootstrap
    styling.
  user_review_goal: Opening the web app on different devices and screen sizes shows a responsive layout with no visual inconsistencies.
- description: Build front-end components for single-player tic-tac-toe game mechanics and integrate game state management
    with Redux.
  programmatic_goal: Players should be able to play a game of tic-tac-toe against the computer on the front end with state
    changes properly managed by Redux.
  user_review_goal: User can engage in a single-player tic-tac-toe game against the computer, with gameplay functioning correctly
    and state managed accurately.
- description: Implement the multiplayer gameplay functionality using Socket.io for real-time communication between clients
    and the server.
  programmatic_goal: Two clients can connect to the server and play a tic-tac-toe game against each other in real-time with
    consistent state updates.
  user_review_goal: Two users can play a multiplayer game of tic-tac-toe with each other in real-time, with actions by one
    player instantly reflected on the other player's screen.
- description: Create a leaderboard system that records user statistics such as wins, losses, and ties, and use MongoDB to
    persist this data.
  programmatic_goal: After each game, the player statistics are updated in the database and can be queried and displayed on
    the leaderboard.
  user_review_goal: Following game completion, verify that the player's statistics (wins, losses, ties) are updated and correctly
    displayed in a leaderboard format.
- description: Integrate pre-recorded audio responses using howler.js for in-game events such as victories and ties.
  programmatic_goal: Audio responses are played at appropriate in-game events; for example, a victory sound plays when a player
    wins, and a tie sound plays when the game is a draw.
  user_review_goal: Verify that the right audio sounds are played during the corresponding game events, like winning or drawing
    a game.
- description: Ensure the backend is set up to handle CORS using the `cors` npm package to allow for secure cross-origin requests.
  programmatic_goal: The Express server is configured with CORS middleware to properly handle cross-origin requests from different
    domains.
  user_review_goal: Confirm through front-end client tests and server logs that cross-origin requests are successfully completed
    without CORS errors.
